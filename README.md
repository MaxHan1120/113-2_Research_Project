# 113-2 Research Project

This repository contains the research results and supplementary materials from our **113 Academic Year, 2nd Semester** undergraduate research project at the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University.

## 📘 Project Overview

- **Project Title**: An RC Oscillator With Comparator Offset Cancellation  
- **Advisor**: Prof. Tsung-Hsien Lin (林宗賢教授)
- **Semester**: 113-2 (Spring 2025)

The research explores the design and simulation of a low-power RC oscillator with offset cancellation techniques, focusing on reducing power consumption while maintaining frequency stability under temperature, supply voltage, and mismatch variations.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `/Scripts/` — Python scripts used for post-simulation analysis, particularly **Allan deviation computation** and plotting.
- `/Report/` or root — Project report(s), presentations, and diagrams.

For simulation details, circuit architecture, and Allan deviation analysis, please refer to the attached document:

## 📈 Allan Deviation Analysis

Allan deviation is used in this project to evaluate the oscillator’s long-term frequency stability. Python scripts in the `Scripts/` folder allow you to compute and visualize Allan deviation based on time-domain waveform data. For theoretical background and trade-off discussion, refer to **Appendix B** in the PDF.
